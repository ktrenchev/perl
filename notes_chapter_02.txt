1) Use diagnostics; => More descriptive warnings.

2) In automatic conversions perl does not recognise octal, hex or binary forms. For example 'avg' x '011' will give 'avg' 11 times instead of 'avg' 9 times.

3) chr( <number> ) => returns the character denoded by that number.
   ord( <number> ) => returns the number assosciated with that character.

4) "In fact nearly every sequence of punctuation is used for something in Perl" xD True story (36p, Learning Perl).

5) chomp( $var ) => removes trailing newline. Returns the number of \n
deleter ( 0 / 1 ). 

6) reading user input => <STDIN>. Possibly <> is the operator and STDIN
is just and argument.

7) If one wants to print multiple things to stdout ( for example a
string literal followed by a function call return value followed by
a new line ), one must give print a comma separated list of things
to print.
